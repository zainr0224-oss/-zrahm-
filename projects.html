<h3>Design Project</h3>
<p>My design project was a project based on prototyping an application that would be beneficial for many people. In my case this application benefitted football fans across Europe</p>
<p>This application was designed to compare players accross Europe's top 5 leagues. The software I used to help create this prototype is called Figma.</p>
